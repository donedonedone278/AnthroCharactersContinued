The streets are packed with people... they either seem in a mad hurry, or lost in a daze, unaware of their surroundings. I miss Pelican Town already!^^I begin the tour this evening, at a local bookstore. I must admit, I'm becoming a bit nervous at the thought of public speaking... my stomach feels as if it's been twisted into a soft pretzel and doused with spicy cheese dip. Wish me luck!^^-Love, {{Elliott}}^^P.S. I hope you had a peaceful night, and weren't too scared all alone in that big house! %item conversationTopic ElliottGone2 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife",

Still, I sold enough copies of the book to pay for my (bug-infested) hotel room!^^In a few hours, I leave for Zuzu City. If yesterday's reading was a warm-up, this next one will be a true napalm blast...^^I miss you very much. Remember to eat well! Oh, and don't forget the leftover crab cakes I put in the fridge...^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone3 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 2",

It seems there's a large literary scene here... a few dozen people showed up at my reading!^^I even signed a couple of autographs... it's strange to be seen as someone important. It's all a matter of framing, a grand illusion... for truly I am no one special. Only your devoted {{Elliott}}, as always.^^Currently I'm alone, in my hotel room, 'ingesting' a Joja Value Meal...^^Should this be called 'food'?^Or 'edible matter'?^I needn't long brood^It must be the latter^^I look forward to returning home soon. Hope you enjoyed the crab cakes.^^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone4 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 3",

I can't wait to return and see what progress has been made.^^On these long travels between towns, I amuse myself by closing my eyes and envisioning the farm... I see kegs pulsing with sweet wine, a furnace ablaze with precious ore, and our little kitchen with the smell of cinnamon and nutmeg. There's a lot to enjoy!^^Just don't stay out too late in the mines, my love. It's dangerous in there! If you must go... bring plenty of food.^^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone6 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 5",

It's been nice to meet people who enjoy my work, but I'm eager to return home.^^I look forward to the comfort of our little house, the satisfying farm work, a home-cooked meal, and most of all, cozying into the flannel sheets with you.^^See you soon!^-Love, {{Elliott}} %item conversationTopic ElliottGone7 0 %%[#]Letter From My Wife 6"
